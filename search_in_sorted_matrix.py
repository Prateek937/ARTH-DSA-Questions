Search in Sorted Matrix :

You are given 2D array - Matrix of distinct integers and a target integer.
Each row in the matrix is sorted, and each column is also sorted, the matrix does not necessarily have the same height and width

Write a function that returns an array of the row and column indices of the target integer if its contained in the matrix, otherwise [ -1 , -1 ]

Sample Input :

matrix = [ 
	[ 1 ,4 ,7 ,2, 15, 1000 ],
	[ 2, 5, 19, 31, 32, 1001],
	[ 3, 8, 24, 33, 35, 1002],
	[ 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 1003],
	[ 99, 100, 103, 106, 128, 1004]
]

target = 44

Sample output:
[ 3 , 3 ]
